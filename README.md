# PyBackup

PyBackup is a sequential multi-target backup tool with a user-friendly GUI. It allows you to back up a source directory to multiple target directories, with intelligent space management and progress tracking.

## About This Project

This project serves as a proof of concept for "vibe coding" with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, showcasing how AI assistance can streamline development workflow and enhance productivity. The core functionality was developed through collaborative sessions with Gemini 2.5 Pro, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted programming. This README file was generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

## Features

- Wizard-like interface for easy configuration
- Support for multiple backup targets with automatic switching
- Configurable free space requirements for target drives
- Automatic retry for failed operations
- Detailed real-time progress monitoring
- Internationalization support (currently English and French)
- Pause/resume functionality
- Detailed logging

```bash
# Generate/update translation template
./update_translations.sh

# Compile translations after editing
./apply_translations.sh
```
